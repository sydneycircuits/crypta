Quite easy, with MacsBug installed. 

  Launch 4D. At the password dialog, press the interrupt button
(Clover-Startup Key on modern Macs).

  You are now in the MacsBug debugger. Type:

    ATBA SysBeep ';ATC ;T ;G PC+4' ;g

  You are now back to the 4D password dialog. Type any password. You are
now into your database. I suggest you use the Passwords menu to give you a
password you will remember this time.

  Was that hard enough?
